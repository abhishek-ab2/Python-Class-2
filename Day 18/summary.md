### Covered topics
- global and nonlocal keywords
- else keyword (in-depth)

### global
- Used to explicitly mention that the variable is of global scope, so as to allow modifying the value of the variable rather than creating a new local variable
Syntax: global var_name
        var_name = 10

### nonlocal
- Used to explicitly mention that the variable is of nonlocal scope, so as to allow modifying the value of the variable rather than creating a new local variable
Syntax: nonlocal var_name
        var_name = 10

### for-else
- else clause executes when there was no un-natural interruption during the iteration and loop exits normally

### try-except-else
- else clause executes when no exception was raised in try block
