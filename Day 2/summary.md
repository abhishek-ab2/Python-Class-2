# Covered Topics
- mutability/immutability
- list
- tuple
- dictionary

## List
- Mutable in nature
- Can store diff data types
- Supports all the array operations
- + in list performs combining lists

### Syntax - lst = [1,2,8.6]

## tuple
- Similar to list
- Immutable in nature

### Syntax - tpl = (1,2, 'asdf', 9.0)

## Indexing
- Indexes start from 0
- Negative indexes start from -1(last element)
- Slicing - Slice of a list, syntax: [start:end:steps]


## Dictionary
- Accessed by keys, key can be any mutable data type
- Doesn't support slicing

## Set
- Similar to list, but only contains unique elements, no indexing is allowed.


## String
- Similar to tuple

# Assignments
- Program - Nested list, tuples and dictionary and print it.
- Research - list comprehension and dictionary comprehension, extra point if you do the program.


# Research
- List creation in a single line
- It is actually faster than appending

## Disadvantages
- You can not have complex statements
