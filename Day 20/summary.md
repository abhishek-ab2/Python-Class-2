### Suggestions
- Follow python's naming convention
- Variable must hint the data stored in the variable
- Reduce code redundancy, similar classes can be reused if they have similar functionality
- Attributes or data that can change in a game should be passed through parameters

### Changes needed
- We can reuse Strip class for all the strips and store strips in track.
- We can reuse sound, and move game crashing check to player as a flag
- We need a game object
