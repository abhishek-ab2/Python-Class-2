## Covered Topics
- branching statements
- loops
- comparison operations
- Operators


## Branching (if/else):
- You have if, elif and else. For body declaration we use indent


## Comparison Operators:
-  <, >, ==, !=, >=, <=, is, is not, or, and


## For loop
- Basic syntax for i in range(10)
- For loop runs the loop as long as there are elements in the iterable object

## While loop
- Syntax:
    while <condition>:
        <body>


### diff between while and for:
- For loop is used when the number of iterations are pre determined
- While is used when number of iterations are not pre determined but condition is there to continue the loop

### Iterable objects are objects which contain other objects as elements for ex: tuple, list, dict, set, string


## Operators:
- Arithmetic - +, -, /, *, //
- Logical - ==, !=, <, > , <=, >= ,or, and, in, is, is not, not
- Bool - |, &, ^...

## Assignments
- Take integer input from user
- Run three nested for loops
- and append element to an empty list
- print the list (Can submit on sunday, on the repo)
- First two (possible this one as well). Add these to the repo 
  (Higher priority)
