- Assertion are user defined conditions and an exception is raised when the condition is violated
- User defined in nature

## NameError

## UnboundLocalError
- When a variable is accessed before its initialised or does not exist in the scope

## RecursionError
- When recursion has reached maximum depth allowed by the interpreter's configuration
